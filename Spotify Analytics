## For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

-- Create table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

-- 1. What is the AVG popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track?
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

-- 2. Who are the top 10 artists? 
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

-- 3. How many artists have more than 1 song included in Spotify? 
WITH tempTable AS (
SELECT artist_name, count(track_id)
FROM SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING count(track_id) > 1)
SELECT count(artist_name) FROM tempTable 

-- 4. What artist released the longest song? 
SELECT artist_name as Artist, 
track_name as Song, 
max(duration_ms) as Duration 
from spotifydata 
order by Duration
limit by 1; 

-- 5a. Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table.
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)

-- 5b. For every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
SELECT  artist_name,
average_popularity,
'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
